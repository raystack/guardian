# Managing Appeals

An appeal is essentially a request created by users to give them access to resources. In order to grant the access, an appeal has to be approved by approvers which is assigned based on the applied policy. Appeal contains information about the requested account, the creator, the selected resources, the specific role for accessing the resource, and options to determine the behaviour of the access e.g. permanent or temporary access.

## Creating Appeals

Guardian creates access for users to resources with configurable approval flow. Appeal created by user with specifying which resource they want to access and also the role.

### Appeal Lifecycle

![](/assets/appeal-lifecycle.png)

#### Appeal Status

- `pending` \(initial status\): During this state, the appeal will evaluate approval steps one by one. The result from the approval steps evaluation will determine whether the appeal will be approved or rejected.
- `rejected`: The appeal has at least one failed approval step.
- `active`: The appeal has been approved. As long as the appeal is in this status, the user will have the access to the designated resource.
- `terminated`: An active access can be revoked by any authorized user at any time, or, if the appeal already exceeds the lifetime limit then it will automatically get revoked.
- `canceled`: The appeal canceled by the creator when the status was on pending.

#### Actions

- Approve: Called when all the approval steps are passed/approved.
- Reject: Called when there is one approval step that is rejected.
- Revoke: A manual action that is called by an authorized user intentionally to revoke an active access.
- Expire: If the appeal specifies the expiration policy then it will automatically get expired when it is already passed the lifetime limit.
- Recreate: Possible for appeals that are currently still active, rejected, or terminated. This action will create a new appeal based on the previous one. For the appeal coming from active status, there is a policy related to access extension.

#### Appeals can be created in the following ways:
1. Using `guardian appeal create` CLI command
2. Calling to `POST /api/v1beta1/appeals` API

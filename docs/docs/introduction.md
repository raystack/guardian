# Introduction

Welcome to the introductory guide to Guardian! This guide is the best place to start with Guardian. We cover what Guardian is, what problems it can solve, how it works, and how you can get started using it. If you are familiar with the basics of Guardian, the guide provides a more detailed reference of available features.

## What is Guardian?

Guardian is an on-demand access management tool with automated access workflows and security controls across data stores, analytical systems, and cloud products. It allows you to manage secure and compliant self-service data access for multiple resources with multiple stakeholders. Users are required to raise an appeal to gain access to a particular resource. The appeal will go through several approvals before it gets approved and grants access to the user.

## The problem we aim to solve

Organizational teams in charge of authenticating user identities and managing access to corporate resources require the IT staff to provision access manually. The longer it takes for a user to gain access to crucial business data, the less productive that user will be. On the flip side, failing to revoke the access rights of employees who have left the organization or transferred to different departments can have serious security consequences. To close this window of exposure and risk, IT staff must de-provision access to corporate data as quickly as possible. Manual provisioning and de-provisioning of access are labor-intensive and prone to human error or oversights. Especially for large organizations, it is not an efficient or sustainable way to manage user identities and access.

Guardian is designed to ensure that our enterprise has robust security controls in place while streamlining authentication procedures to increase user productivity. In conclusion, Guardian is an essential part of ensuring that employees are both empowered to deliver that value and prevented from damaging the businessâ€™s reputation or security.

## How does it work?

Resource administrators need to register a data provider on Guardian along with an access policy. The policy defines all the steps that a request needs to pass through before access is granted for a resource. The appeal can either be manually approved or automatically checked according to the conditions defined in the policy before passing it to the next step of the policy. The policy can also have multiple approvers associated with an appeal.

Users are required to raise an appeal to gain access to a particular resource. The appeal will go through all the approvals/steps defined for that particular resource before it gets approved and the access is granted to the user.

## Key Features

- **Provider Management**: Support various providers \(currently _BigQuery, Google Cloud Storage Metabase, Grafana, and Tableau, Google Cloud IAM_ with more coming up!\) and multiple instances for each provider type.
- **Resource Management**: Resources from a provider are managed in Guardian's database. There is also an API to update the resource's metadata to add additional information.
- **Appeal-based access**: Users are expected to create an appeal for accessing data from registered providers. The appeal will get reviewed by the configured approvers before it gives access to the user.
- **Configurable approval flow**: The approval flow configures what is needed for an appeal to get approved and who is eligible to approve/reject. It can be configured and linked to a provider so that every appeal created to their resources will follow the procedure to get approved.
- **External Identity Manager**: This gives the flexibility to use any third-party identity manager. User properties.

## Using Guardian

You can manage the data access for your resource via Guardian in any of the following ways:

#### Guardian Command Line Interface

You can use the Guardian command line interface to issue commands and to perform the entire data access flow. Using the command line can be faster and more convenient than the console.
For more information on using the Guardian CLI, see the [CLI Reference](./reference/cli.md) page.

#### HTTPS API

You can get hands on appeal creation, approval updatation, access revocation and much more by using the Guardian HTTPS API, which lets you issue HTTPS requests directly to the service. When you use the HTTPS API, you must include the username in the request header, which will be used by [Frontier](https://guardian.vercel.app/frontier/) for authorization. For more information, see the [API Reference](/reference/api.md) page.

## Where to go from here

See the [installation](./installation) page to install the Guardian CLI. Next, we recommend completing the guides. The tour provides an overview of most of the existing functionality of Guardian and takes approximately 30 minutes to complete.

After completing the tour, check out the remainder of the documentation in the reference and concepts sections for your specific areas of interest. We've aimed to provide as much documentation as we can for the various components of Guardian to give you a full understanding of Guardian's surface area.

Finally, follow the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/raystack/guardian), and contact us if you'd like to get involved.
